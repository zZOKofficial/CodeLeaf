# CodeLeaf - বাংলায় প্রোগ্রামিং

**CodeLeaf** is an Android app project that aims to make programming more accessible by providing resources, tutorials, and examples in the **Bengali language**.  
Most programming materials available online are in English, which can make it difficult for Bengali-speaking learners to start their coding journey. This project is my attempt to bridge that gap.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

The app currently focuses on beginner-friendly and essential programming topics:

- **HTML & CSS** — Basics of web structure and design  
- **PHP** — Server-side scripting fundamentals  
- **SQL** — Introduction to databases and queries  
- **C Programming** — Core concepts of programming  
- **Python** — Beginner to intermediate programming concepts  

As the project grows, more languages and features will be added.  
Future updates may also include **multi-language support** so that the app can be translated into other native languages.

## 🎯 Goals of the Project

- Provide **free, accessible programming resources** in Bengali  
- Encourage **new learners** to explore coding without language barriers  
- Create a **community-driven project** where developers and translators can contribute  
- Showcase my journey of building Android apps and learning along the way

---

## 🚀 Status

- This is a **work in progress**.  
- Initial focus: building the Android app and populating it with beginner-friendly content.  
- Planned future release on **Google Play Store** (timeline not fixed yet).

## 🤝 Contributions

I plan to make this a **community-collaborative project** in the future.  
Once the app is published and stable, I welcome contributions in the form of:

- New tutorials or lessons  
- Code improvements  
- Translations into other languages  

For now, you’re welcome to explore the repo, suggest ideas, or report issues.
